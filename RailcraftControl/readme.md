Lizzy Trickster's Railcraft Control & Automation Suite
======

If you are viewing this on the `master` branch, these programs should work fine. The `Dev` may-or-may not work. 

If a script doesn't work on the `master` branch please notify me. Some parts of this suite may not be complete but still in the master branch, you have been warned


The following is a list of parts and their working/completed state:
- [ ] RITRP
- [x] SignalControl
- [ ] TrainAutomation


This code is unlikely to be worked on much more as the motivation I had for it has now all gone.
